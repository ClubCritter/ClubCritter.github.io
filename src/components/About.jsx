                <h3>Simple and Transparent!</h3>
                  <p>We're all about clarity and trust. That's why we're the first to launch a fully transparent KYC'd and audited token. Our roadmap is straightforward:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Website Creation</li>
                      <li>Token Launch</li>
                      <li>Discord Launch</li>
                      <li>Community Building</li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>Join us on <a href='https://discord.gg/U5EMjSvb4s' target='_blank'>Discord</a> where Head Critter and Mama Critter will be hosting $CRITTER giveaways! We value your input, so let's work together to expand both the community and the Kadena ecosystem. Remember, the stronger we become, the more benefits everyone enjoys!</p>
                  <p>Leading the charge is Papa Critter, who is fully KYC'd and chats directly witha a couple of guys from Kadena and independant developers. He's passionate about keeping things fun, exciting, and constantly growing, and he's always here to listen to your ideas! :)</p>
